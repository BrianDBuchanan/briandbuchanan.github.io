		I've been able to travel to over 40 states plus Canada and Mexico. Out of all the places I've been and lived I think Cincinnati is my favorite. Growing up near it and living downtown during college made me fall in love with it! I'm a huge fan of it's sports teams and Skyline Chili! I love going back to visit family and friends. I also loved having 4 distinct seasons and getting large amounts of snow!

		Hopefully in the near future I'll be able to travel outside of North America and see other parts of the world!
