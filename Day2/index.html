		I was born in San Diego, CA but grew up for most of my life in Dayton, Ohio. I moved to Charleston 2 years ago with my wife and dogs. I went to college for radio & television production and got a few part time gigs as a producer at various radio stations. I'm also a self-taught graphic designer so I hope to use all those skills and my new coding skills to land a great job in the near future!
